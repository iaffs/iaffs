# Hei, my name is Ingrid-Alice:wave:




#### I'm 27 years young, and as a mobile developer in Oslo:woman:

---




I am not married to any technology, framework or language, but I enjoy cross-platform and app development :computer:

I strive to become a kickass developer, and for some time that has been my main goal.



Besides that I absolutely love to cook food, not to mention eating food. I love all kinds of food:stew::ramen::pizza:
I also enjoy a glass of wine or beer from time to time.


I love to build or make things, whether it be with my hands or my brain.
